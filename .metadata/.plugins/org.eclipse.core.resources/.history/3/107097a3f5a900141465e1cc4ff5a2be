/*
* This class should calculate the tax on an item
* sold to somewhere in Mario World. In Mario World, 
* the tax rate is 4% (0.04) for any item weighing
* under 100 pounds, and 8% on any item weighing
* 100 pounds or more.
* 
* You MUST extend TaxCalculator to get credit. You
* must use the taxRate variable in the superclass
* and call the super class constructor.
* 
* You must also override the toString method to
* return
* MarioWorldTaxCalculator[taxRate=TAX_RATE]
* Where TAX_RATE should be either 0.04 or 0.08 based
* on the weight of the item being taxed.
* 
* This class must have a constructor with one arguments,
* which is a double that represents the weight in pounds 
* of the object to be taxed.
