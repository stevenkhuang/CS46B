 * This class should calculate the tax on an item

 * rate of ten dollars (10.00) on every item plus
 * 5% (0.05) times the original amount on any item 
 * with a "5" in the amount.
 * 
 * You MUST extend TaxCalculator to get credit. You
 * must use the taxRate variable in the superclass
 * and call the super class constructor.
 * 
 * You must also override the toString method to
 * return
 * WarioLandTaxCalculator[taxRate=0.01]
 * 
 * This class must have a constructor with no arguments.
